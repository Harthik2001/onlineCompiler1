**Online Compiler for Coding Assessments**

**2\. Summary**
---------------

The goal is to develop an online compiler with a user-friendly UI that supports multiple programming languages, including Python, C, C++, Java, and Go. The platform should allow multiple users to create accounts, log in, write, compile, and execute code in real-time. Additionally, it should maintain each user's code submission history for future reference.

This platform will be used for hiring assessments during coding rounds, ensuring a seamless and efficient evaluation process for candidates.

**3\. Objectives/Goals**
------------------------

*   Develop a web-based compiler UI using React for an interactive coding experience.
    
*   Implement a backend using Node.js to handle code execution securely.
    
*   Support multiple programming languages (Python, C, C++, Java, Go).
    
*   Enable user authentication and account management.
    
*   Maintain a history of code submissions for each user.
    
*   Ensure sandboxing and security to prevent malicious code execution.
    
*   Optimize execution performance for handling multiple concurrent users.
    
*   Provide a clean and intuitive UI with syntax highlighting and auto-save functionality.
    
*   Deploy the platform using cloud services for scalability.
